                <p>I opted to not overdesign the solution since it is relatively simple. I structured the
                    app by creating some components used as routing pages namely the "about", "add-speech", and
                    "speeches" pages. The "speeches" component contain the majority of the app display logic. I did not
                    worry too much about creating reusable components since it was mostly not needed, but I demonstrated
                    how that is used using the "header" component found on src/app/layout/header. Communication between
                    pages is handled by triggering events via a shared service called speech-service which also handles
                    the faux data storage for the app. This interaction between components is demonstrated by the seach
                    bar which is on the header, but fires events inside another component via the shared service.
                </p>
                <p>Other misc components are the model which is basically used as a data transfer object, and the error
                    page which shows a bit about routing. I also added some icons using font awesome and a few
                    transition animations on page routing.
                </p>
                <p>The pages were designed mobile first using bootstrap's responsive breakpoints to control the size and
                    flow of the page components as the viewport resizes. I also used some media queries to collapse the
                    listview when on small devices, and a button to expand it.
                </p>
                <p>All in all, what I did is very simple, and concise. And I feel that the problem warranted such. But I
                    do think that I demonstrated my knowledge sufficiently, and hope that it is to you liking. Thank
                    you.
